### 🧮 **1️⃣ Find the Average of Elements in an Array**

**Problem:**
Write a Python program to calculate the **average** of all numbers stored in a list.

**Example Output:**

```
Numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
Average = 15.0
```

### 🔢 **2️⃣ Count Positive, Negative, and Zero Values**

**Problem:**
Create a list of integers and count how many numbers are **positive**, **negative**, and **zeros**.

**Example Output:**

```
Numbers = [5, -2, 0, 8, -7, 0, 3]
Positive = 3  
Negative = 2  
Zeros = 2
```

### 🧠 **3️⃣ Copy Elements from One Array to Another**

**Problem:**
Write a program to copy all elements of one list into another list using a loop.

**Example Output:**

```
Original List = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Copied List = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

### 🔍 **4️⃣ Find the Second Largest Element**

**Problem:**
Write a Python program to find the **second largest** element in a list.

**Example Output:**

```
Numbers = [12, 45, 7, 34, 89, 23]
Second Largest = 45
```

### 🔄 **5️⃣ Separate Even and Odd Numbers into Two Lists**

**Problem:**
Create a list of integers and separate them into **two new lists** — one for even numbers and another for odd numbers.

**Example Output:**

```
Numbers = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66]
Even = [22, 44, 66]
Odd = [11, 33, 55]
```

# üîÅ **Python Assignment 02: Loops Practice**

### **Objective:**

Practice using **for loops** and **while loops** in Python to perform calculations and repetitive tasks.

---

## üß© **Q1. Print Even Numbers between 1 and 20**

Write a program to display all **even numbers** between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

**Hint:**
Use the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is even.

**Expected Output:**

```
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
```

---

## üß© **Q2. Sum of Natural Numbers**

Write a program to calculate the **sum of the first N natural numbers**, where `N` is entered by the user.

**Example Input/Output:**

```
Enter N: 5
Sum = 15
```

**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

## üß© **Q3. Factorial of a Number**

Write a program to calculate the **factorial** of a given number using a loop.

**Formula:**
n! = n √ó (n-1) √ó (n-2) √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó 1

**Example Input/Output:**

```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial = 120
```

---

## üß© **Q4. Sum of Even and Odd Numbers**

Write a program to calculate the **sum of even** and **sum of odd** numbers separately from 1 to N.

**Example Input/Output:**

```
Enter N: 10
Sum of even numbers = 30
Sum of odd numbers = 25
```

### ‚úÖ **Expected Learning Outcomes**

After completing this assignment, students will:

* Understand how to **use loops** in Python.
* Apply loops for **counting, summing, and performing repetitive calculations**.
* Strengthen logical thinking with number-based problems.

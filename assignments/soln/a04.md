# 🧩 **Solutions – Python List Slicing**

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Print the Last 4 Elements of a List**

```python
# Program to print the last 4 elements of a list

numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
last_four = numbers[-4:]

print("Original List:", numbers)
print("Last 4 elements:", last_four)
```

🧠 **Explanation:**
`numbers[-4:]` → starts 4 elements from the end and includes all till the end.

**Output:**

```
Original List: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
Last 4 elements: [25, 30, 35, 40]
```

### ✅ **2️⃣ Print Every 3rd Element**

```python
# Program to print every 3rd element using slicing

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
every_third = data[::3]

print("Original List:", data)
print("Every 3rd element:", every_third)
```

🧠 **Explanation:**
`data[::3]` means: start from the beginning, take every 3rd element (step = 3).

**Output:**

```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
Every 3rd element: [1, 4, 7, 10]
```

### ✅ **3️⃣ Reverse the List using Slicing**

```python
# Program to reverse a list using slicing

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "dates"]
reversed_list = fruits[::-1]

print("Original List:", fruits)
print("Reversed List:", reversed_list)
```

🧠 **Explanation:**
`[::-1]` → reverses the list by taking a step of -1 (moves from end to start).

**Output:**

```
Original List: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'dates']
Reversed List: ['dates', 'cherry', 'banana', 'apple']
```

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Replace the Middle Elements of a List**

```python
# Program to replace the middle two elements using slicing

colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "orange", "purple"]
colors[2:4] = ["black", "white"]

print("After replacement:", colors)
```

🧠 **Explanation:**
`colors[2:4]` → selects elements at index 2 and 3 (i.e., “blue”, “yellow”)
We replace them with `"black"` and `"white"`.

**Output:**

```
After replacement: ['red', 'green', 'black', 'white', 'orange', 'purple']
```

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Combine First and Last 3 Elements**

```python
# Program to combine first and last 3 elements of a list

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
combined = numbers[:3] + numbers[-3:]

print("Original List:", numbers)
print("Combined List:", combined)
```

🧠 **Explanation:**
`numbers[:3]` → first 3 elements
`numbers[-3:]` → last 3 elements
The `+` operator joins the two sublists.

**Output:**

```
Original List: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
Combined List: [10, 20, 30, 70, 80, 90]
```

## ðŸ§® **Assignment: Grade Calculator in Python**

### **Objective:**

Write a Python program to calculate and display the grade of a student based on their percentage.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. Accept the **percentage** as input from the user.
2. Determine the **grade** based on the following criteria:

   * A â†’ 80 and above
   * B â†’ 60 to 79
   * C â†’ 40 to 59
   * D â†’ Below 40
3. Display both **percentage** and **grade** clearly as output.

---

### **Sample Input / Output:**

**Example 1:**

```
Enter your percentage: 85
Percent = 85.0
Grade = A
```

**Example 2:**

```
Enter your percentage: 57.5
Percent = 57.5
Grade = C
```

### **ðŸ’¡ Tasks:**

#### **Task 1:**

Write the program as shown above and test it for different percentage values.

#### **Task 2 (Challenge):**

Modify your program so that:

* It also accepts **student name** as input.
* The output is displayed in a formatted message, for example:

  ```
  Student: Ayesha
  Percentage: 73.5
  Grade: B
  ```

#### **Task 3 (Optional Enhancement):**

* If the percentage is **less than 35**, print an additional message:
  `"Sorry, you have failed. Try again next time."`
* Otherwise, print:
  `"Congratulations! You passed."`

### **Expected Learning Outcomes**

After completing this assignment, students will:

* Understand how to use **ifâ€“elifâ€“else** conditions.
* Learn how to take **user input** and display **formatted output**.
* Get familiar with **conditional logic** and **comparison operators** in Python.
